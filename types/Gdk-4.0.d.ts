         *
         * The content of a `GdkPaintable` can be painted anywhere at any size
         * without requiring any sort of layout. The interface is inspired by
         * similar concepts elsewhere, such as
         * [ClutterContent](https://developer.gnome.org/clutter/stable/ClutterContent.html),
         * [HTML/CSS Paint Sources](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-images-4/#paint-source),
         * or [SVG Paint Servers](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/pservers.html).
         *
         * A `GdkPaintable` can be snapshot at any time and size using
         * [method@Gdk.Paintable.snapshot]. How the paintable interprets that size and
         * if it scales or centers itself into the given rectangle is implementation
         * defined, though if you are implementing a `GdkPaintable` and don't know what
         * to do, it is suggested that you scale your paintable ignoring any potential
         * aspect ratio.
         *
         * The contents that a `GdkPaintable` produces may depend on the [class@Gdk.Snapshot]
         * passed to it. For example, paintables may decide to use more detailed images
         * on higher resolution screens or when OpenGL is available. A `GdkPaintable`
         * will however always produce the same output for the same snapshot.
         *
         * A `GdkPaintable` may change its contents, meaning that it will now produce
         * a different output with the same snapshot. Once that happens, it will call
         * [method@Gdk.Paintable.invalidate_contents] which will emit the
         * [signal@Gdk.Paintable::invalidate-contents] signal. If a paintable is known
         * to never change its contents, it will set the %GDK_PAINTABLE_STATIC_CONTENTS
         * flag. If a consumer cannot deal with changing contents, it may call
         * [method@Gdk.Paintable.get_current_image] which will return a static
         * paintable and use that.
         *
         * A paintable can report an intrinsic (or preferred) size or aspect ratio it
         * wishes to be rendered at, though it doesn't have to. Consumers of the interface
         * can use this information to layout thepaintable appropriately. Just like the
         * contents, the size of a paintable can change. A paintable will indicate this
         * by calling [method@Gdk.Paintable.invalidate_size] which will emit the
         * [signal@Gdk.Paintable::invalidate-size] signal. And just like for contents,
         * if a paintable is known to never change its size, it will set the
         * %GDK_PAINTABLE_STATIC_SIZE flag.
         *
         * Besides API for applications, there are some functions that are only
         * useful for implementing subclasses and should not be used by applications:
         * [method@Gdk.Paintable.invalidate_contents],

         * to modify them later. You should create a new cursor when you want to change
         * something about it.
         *
         * Cursors by themselves are not very interesting: they must be bound to a
         * window for users to see them. This is done with [method@Gdk.Surface.set_cursor]
         * or [method@Gdk.Surface.set_device_cursor]. Applications will typically
         * use higher-level GTK functions such as [gtk_widget_set_cursor()](../gtk4/method.Widget.set_cursor.html)
         * instead.
         *
         * Cursors are not bound to a given [class@Gdk.Display], so they can be shared.
         * However, the appearance of cursors may vary when used on different
         * platforms.
         *
         * ## Named and texture cursors
         *
         * There are multiple ways to create cursors. The platform's own cursors
         * can be created with [ctor@Gdk.Cursor.new_from_name]. That function lists
         * the commonly available names that are shared with the CSS specification.
         * Other names may be available, depending on the platform in use. On some
         * platforms, what images are used for named cursors may be influenced by
         * the cursor theme.
         *
         * Another option to create a cursor is to use [ctor@Gdk.Cursor.new_from_texture]
         * and provide an image to use for the cursor.
         *
         * To ease work with unsupported cursors, a fallback cursor can be provided.
         * If a [class@Gdk.Surface] cannot use a cursor because of the reasons mentioned
         * above, it will try the fallback cursor. Fallback cursors can themselves have
         * fallback cursors again, so it is possible to provide a chain of progressively
         * easier to support cursors. If none of the provided cursors can be supported,
         * the default cursor will be the ultimate fallback.

         * Constructs [class@Gdk.Texture] objects from DMA buffers.
         *
         * DMA buffers are commonly called **_dma-bufs_**.
         *
         * DMA buffers are a feature of the Linux kernel to enable efficient buffer and
         * memory sharing between hardware such as codecs, GPUs, displays, cameras and the
         * kernel drivers controlling them. For example, a decoder may want its output to
         * be directly shared with the display server for rendering without a copy.
         *
         * Any device driver which participates in DMA buffer sharing, can do so as either
         * the exporter or importer of buffers (or both).
         *
         * The memory that is shared via DMA buffers is usually stored in non-system memory
         * (maybe in device's local memory or something else not directly accessible by the
         * CPU), and accessing this memory from the CPU may have higher-than-usual overhead.
         *
         * In particular for graphics data, it is not uncommon that data consists of multiple
         * separate blocks of memory, for example one block for each of the red, green and
         * blue channels. These blocks are called **_planes_**. DMA buffers can have up to
         * four planes. Even if the memory is a single block, the data can be organized in
         * multiple planes, by specifying offsets from the beginning of the data.
         *
         * DMA buffers are exposed to user-space as file descriptors allowing to pass them
         * between processes. If a DMA buffer has multiple planes, there is one file
         * descriptor per plane.
         *
         * The format of the data (for graphics data, essentially its colorspace) is described
         * by a 32-bit integer. These format identifiers are defined in the header file `drm_fourcc.h`
         * and commonly referred to as **_fourcc_** values, since they are identified by 4 ASCII
         * characters. Additionally, each DMA buffer has a **_modifier_**, which is a 64-bit integer
         * that describes driver-specific details of the memory layout, such as tiling or compression.
         *
         * For historical reasons, some producers of dma-bufs don't provide an explicit modifier, but
         * instead return `DMA_FORMAT_MOD_INVALID` to indicate that their modifier is **_implicit_**.
         * GTK tries to accommodate this situation by accepting `DMA_FORMAT_MOD_INVALID` as modifier.
         *
         * The operation of `GdkDmabufTextureBuilder` is quite simple: Create a texture builder,
         * set all the necessary properties, and then call [method@Gdk.DmabufTextureBuilder.build]
         * to create the new texture.
         *
         * The required properties for a dma-buf texture are
         *
         *  * The width and height in pixels
         *
         *  * The `fourcc` code and `modifier` which identify the format and memory layout of the dma-buf
         *
         *  * The file descriptor, offset and stride for each of the planes
         *
         * `GdkDmabufTextureBuilder` can be used for quick one-shot construction of
         * textures as well as kept around and reused to construct multiple textures.

         * the same time (reducing the total number of frames).
         *
         * The frame clock can also automatically stop painting when it knows the frames
         * will not be visible, or scale back animation framerates.
         *
         * `GdkFrameClock` is designed to be compatible with an OpenGL-based implementation
         * or with mozRequestAnimationFrame in Firefox, for example.
         *
         * A frame clock is idle until someone requests a frame with
         * [method@Gdk.FrameClock.request_phase]. At some later point that makes sense
         * for the synchronization being implemented, the clock will process a frame and
         * emit signals for each phase that has been requested. (See the signals of the
         * `GdkFrameClock` class for documentation of the phases.
         * %GDK_FRAME_CLOCK_PHASE_UPDATE and the [signal@Gdk.FrameClock::update] signal
         * are most interesting for application writers, and are used to update the
         * animations, using the frame time given by [method@Gdk.FrameClock.get_frame_time].
         *
         * The frame time is reported in microseconds and generally in the same

         * as g_get_monotonic_time(). The frame time does not advance during

         * [method@Gdk.Surface.create_gl_context], and the context will match
         * the characteristics of the surface.
         *
         * A `GdkGLContext` is not tied to any particular normal framebuffer.
         * For instance, it cannot draw to the surface back buffer. The GDK
         * repaint system is in full control of the painting to that. Instead,
         * you can create render buffers or textures and use [func@cairo_draw_from_gl]
         * in the draw function of your widget to draw them. Then GDK will handle
         * the integration of your rendering with that of other widgets.
         *
         * Support for `GdkGLContext` is platform-specific and context creation
         * can fail, returning %NULL context.
         *
         * A `GdkGLContext` has to be made "current" in order to start using

         *
         * ## Creating a new OpenGL context
         *
         * In order to create a new `GdkGLContext` instance you need a `GdkSurface`,
         * which you typically get during the realize call of a widget.
         *
         * A `GdkGLContext` is not realized until either [method@Gdk.GLContext.make_current]
         * or [method@Gdk.GLContext.realize] is called. It is possible to specify
         * details of the GL context like the OpenGL version to be used, or whether
         * the GL context should have extra state validation enabled after calling
         * [method@Gdk.Surface.create_gl_context] by calling [method@Gdk.GLContext.realize].
         * If the realization fails you have the option to change the settings of
         * the `GdkGLContext` and try again.
         *
         * ## Using a GdkGLContext
         *
         * You will need to make the `GdkGLContext` the current context before issuing
         * OpenGL calls; the system sends OpenGL commands to whichever context is current.
         * It is possible to have multiple contexts, so you always need to ensure that
         * the one which you want to draw with is the current one before issuing commands:
         *
         * ```c
         * gdk_gl_context_make_current (context);
         * ```
         *
         * You can now perform your drawing using OpenGL commands.
         *
         * You can check which `GdkGLContext` is the current one by using
         * [func@Gdk.GLContext.get_current]; you can also unset any `GdkGLContext`
         * that is currently set by calling [func@Gdk.GLContext.clear_current].
