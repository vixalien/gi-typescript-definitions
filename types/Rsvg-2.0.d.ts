         * `.
         * This is so that malicious SVG files cannot include files that are in a directory above.
         *
         * The full set of rules for deciding which URLs may be loaded is as follows;
         * they are applied in order.  A referenced URL will not be loaded as soon as
         * one of these rules fails:
         *
         * 1. All `data:` URLs may be loaded.  These are sometimes used
         *    to include raster image data, encoded as base-64, directly in an SVG file.
         *
         * 2. URLs with queries ("?") or fragment identifiers ("#") are not allowed.
         *
         * 3. All URL schemes other than data: in references require a base URL.  For
         *    example, this means that if you load an SVG with
         *    [ctor@Rsvg.Handle.new_from_data] without calling [method@Rsvg.Handle.set_base_uri],
         *    then any referenced files will not be allowed (e.g. raster images to be
         *    loaded from other files will not work).
         *
         * 4. If referenced URLs are absolute, rather than relative, then they must
         *    have the same scheme as the base URL.  For example, if the base URL has a
         *    `file` scheme, then all URL references inside the SVG must
         *    also have the `file` scheme, or be relative references which
         *    will be resolved against the base URL.
         *
         * 5. If referenced URLs have a `resource` scheme, that is,
         *    if they are included into your binary program with GLib's resource
         *    mechanism, they are allowed to be loaded (provided that the base URL is
         *    also a `resource`, per the previous rule).
         *
         * 6. Otherwise, non-`file` schemes are not allowed.  For
         *    example, librsvg will not load `http` resources, to keep
         *    malicious SVG data from "phoning home".
         *
         * 7. URLs with a `file` scheme are rejected if they contain a hostname, as in
         *    `file://hostname/some/directory/foo.svg`.  Windows UNC paths with a hostname are
         *    also rejected.  This is to prevent documents from trying to access resources on
         *    other machines.
         *
         * 8. A relative URL must resolve to the same directory as the base URL, or to
         *    one of its subdirectories.  Librsvg will canonicalize filenames, by
         *    removing ".." path components and resolving symbolic links, to decide whether
         *    files meet these conditions.
         *
         * # Loading an SVG with GIO
         *
         * This is the easiest and most resource-efficient way of loading SVG data into
         * an [class@Rsvg.Handle].
         *
         * If you have a `GFile` that stands for an SVG file, you can simply call
         * [ctor@Rsvg.Handle.new_from_gfile_sync] to load an [class@Rsvg.Handle] from it.
         *
         * Alternatively, if you have a `GInputStream`, you can use
         * [ctor@Rsvg.Handle.new_from_stream_sync].
         *
         * Both of those methods allow specifying a `GCancellable`, so the loading
         * process can be cancelled from another thread.
         *
         * ## Loading an SVG from memory
         *
         * If you already have SVG data in a byte buffer in memory, you can create a
         * memory input stream with [ctor@Gio.MemoryInputStream.new_from_data] and feed that
         * to [ctor@Rsvg.Handle.new_from_stream_sync].
         *
         * Note that in this case, it is important that you specify the base_file for
         * the in-memory SVG data.  Librsvg uses the base_file to resolve links to
         * external content, like raster images.
         *
         * # Loading an SVG without GIO
         *
         * You can load an [class@Rsvg.Handle] from a simple filename or URI with
         * [ctor@Rsvg.Handle.new_from_file].  Note that this is a blocking operation; there
         * is no way to cancel it if loading a remote URI takes a long time.  Also, note that
         * this method does not let you specify [flags@Rsvg.HandleFlags].
         *
         * Otherwise, loading an SVG without GIO is not recommended, since librsvg will
         * need to buffer your entire data internally before actually being able to
         * parse it.  The deprecated way of doing this is by creating a handle with
         * [ctor@Rsvg.Handle.new] or [ctor@Rsvg.Handle.new_with_flags], and then using
         * [method@Rsvg.Handle.write] and [method@Rsvg.Handle.close] to feed the handle with SVG data.
         * Still, please try to use the GIO stream functions instead.
         *
         * # Resolution of the rendered image (dots per inch, or DPI)
         *
         * SVG images can contain dimensions like "`5cm`" or
         * "`2pt`" that must be converted from physical units into
         * device units.  To do this, librsvg needs to know the actual dots per inch
         * (DPI) of your target device.  You can call [method@Rsvg.Handle.set_dpi] or
         * [method@Rsvg.Handle.set_dpi_x_y] on an [class@Rsvg.Handle] to set the DPI before rendering
         * it.
         *
         * For historical reasons, the default DPI is 90.  Current CSS assumes a default DPI of 96, so
         * you may want to set the DPI of a [class@Rsvg.Handle] immediately after creating it with
         * [method@Rsvg.Handle.set_dpi].
         *
         * # Rendering
         *
         * The preferred way to render a whole SVG document is to use
         * [method@Rsvg.Handle.render_document].  Please see its documentation for
         * details.
         *
         * # API ordering
         *
         * Due to the way the librsvg API evolved over time, an [class@Rsvg.Handle] object is available
         * for use as soon as it is constructed.  However, not all of its methods can be
         * called at any time.  For example, an [class@Rsvg.Handle] just constructed with [ctor@Rsvg.Handle.new]
         * is not loaded yet, and it does not make sense to call [method@Rsvg.Handle.render_document] on it
         * just at that point.
         *
         * The documentation for the available methods in [class@Rsvg.Handle] may mention that a particular
         * method is only callable on a "fully loaded handle".  This means either:
         *
         * * The handle was loaded with [method@Rsvg.Handle.write] and [method@Rsvg.Handle.close], and
         *   those functions returned no errors.
         *
         * * The handle was loaded with [method@Rsvg.Handle.read_stream_sync] and that function
         *   returned no errors.
         *
         * Before librsvg 2.46, the library did not fully verify that a handle was in a
         * fully loaded state for the methods that require it.  To preserve
         * compatibility with old code which inadvertently called the API without
         * checking for errors, or which called some methods outside of the expected
         * order, librsvg will just emit a `g_critical()` message in those cases.
         *
         * New methods introduced in librsvg 2.46 and later will check for the correct
         * ordering, and panic if they are called out of order.  This will abort
         * the program as if it had a failed assertion.
