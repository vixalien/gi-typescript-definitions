         *
         * #AtkTable should be implemented by components which present
         * elements ordered via rows and columns.  It may also be used to
         * present tree-structured information if the nodes of the trees can
         * be said to contain multiple "columns".  Individual elements of an
         * #AtkTable are typically referred to as "cells". Those cells should
         * implement the interface #AtkTableCell, but #Atk doesn't require
         * them to be direct children of the current #AtkTable. They can be
         * grand-children, grand-grand-children etc. #AtkTable provides the
         * API needed to get a individual cell based on the row and column
         * numbers.
         *
         * Children of #AtkTable are frequently "lightweight" objects, that
         * is, they may not have backing widgets in the host UI toolkit.  They
         * are therefore often transient.
         *
         * Since tables are often very complex, #AtkTable includes provision
         * for offering simplified summary information, as well as row and
         * column headers and captions.  Headers and captions are #AtkObjects
         * which may implement other interfaces (#AtkText, #AtkImage, etc.) as
         * appropriate.  #AtkTable summaries may themselves be (simplified)
         * #AtkTables, etc.
         *
         * Note for implementors: in the past, #AtkTable required that all the
         * cells should be direct children of #AtkTable, and provided some
         * index based methods to request the cells. The practice showed that
         * that forcing made #AtkTable implementation complex, and hard to
         * expose other kind of children, like rows or captions. Right now,
         * index-based methods are deprecated.
