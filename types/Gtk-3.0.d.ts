         *   #GtkWidgetClass.size_allocate() function.
         *
         * - When the parent allocates space to the scrollable child widget,
         *   the widget should update the adjustments’ properties with new values.
         *
         * - When any of the adjustments emits the #GtkAdjustment::value-changed signal,

         * The #GtkTreeModel interface contains two methods for reference
         * counting: gtk_tree_model_ref_node() and gtk_tree_model_unref_node().
         * These two methods are optional to implement. The reference counting
         * is meant as a way for views to let models know when nodes are being
         * displayed. #GtkTreeView will take a reference on a node when it is
         * visible, which means the node is either in the toplevel or expanded.
         * Being displayed does not mean that the node is currently directly
         * visible to the user in the viewport. Based on this reference counting
         * scheme a caching model, for example, can decide whether or not to cache
         * a node based on the reference count. A file-system based model would
         * not want to keep the entire file hierarchy in memory, but just the
         * folders that are currently expanded in every current view.
         *
         * When working with reference counting, the following rules must be taken
         * into account:
         *
         * - Never take a reference on a node without owning a reference on its parent.
         *   This means that all parent nodes of a referenced node must be referenced
         *   as well.
         *
         * - Outstanding references on a deleted node are not released. This is not
         *   possible because the node has already been deleted by the time the
         *   row-deleted signal is received.
         *
         * - Models are not obligated to emit a signal on rows of which none of its
         *   siblings are referenced. To phrase this differently, signals are only
         *   required for levels in which nodes are referenced. For the root level
         *   however, signals must be emitted at all times (however the root level
         *   is always referenced when any view is attached).

         * this widget as part of a larger widget if you have special needs.
         *
         * #GtkAppChooserWidget offers detailed control over what applications
         * are shown, using the
         * #GtkAppChooserWidget:show-default,
         * #GtkAppChooserWidget:show-recommended,
         * #GtkAppChooserWidget:show-fallback,

         * #GtkAppChooserWidget:show-all
         * properties. See the #GtkAppChooser documentation for more information
         * about these groups of applications.
         *
         * To keep track of the selected application, use the
         * #GtkAppChooserWidget::application-selected and #GtkAppChooserWidget::application-activated signals.
         *

        /**
         * #GtkApplication is a class that handles many important aspects
         * of a GTK+ application in a convenient fashion, without enforcing
         * a one-size-fits-all application model.
         *
         * Currently, GtkApplication handles GTK+ initialization, application
         * uniqueness, session management, provides some basic scriptability and
         * desktop shell integration by exporting actions and menus and manages a
         * list of toplevel windows whose life-cycle is automatically tied to the
         * life-cycle of your application.
         *
         * While GtkApplication works fine with plain #GtkWindows, it is recommended
         * to use it together with #GtkApplicationWindow.
         *
         * When GDK threads are enabled, GtkApplication will acquire the GDK
         * lock when invoking actions that arrive from other processes.  The GDK
         * lock is not touched for local action invocations.  In order to have
         * actions invoked in a predictable context it is therefore recommended
         * that the GDK lock be held while invoking actions locally with
         * g_action_group_activate_action().  The same applies to actions
         * associated with #GtkApplicationWindow and to the “activate” and
         * “open” #GApplication methods.
         *
         * ## Automatic resources ## {#automatic-resources}
         *
         * #GtkApplication will automatically load menus from the #GtkBuilder
         * resource located at "gtk/menus.ui", relative to the application's
         * resource base path (see g_application_set_resource_base_path()).  The
         * menu with the ID "app-menu" is taken as the application's app menu
         * and the menu with the ID "menubar" is taken as the application's
         * menubar.  Additional menus (most interesting submenus) can be named
         * and accessed via gtk_application_get_menu_by_id() which allows for
         * dynamic population of a part of the menu structure.
         *
         * If the resources "gtk/menus-appmenu.ui" or "gtk/menus-traditional.ui" are
         * present then these files will be used in preference, depending on the value
         * of gtk_application_prefers_app_menu(). If the resource "gtk/menus-common.ui"
         * is present it will be loaded as well. This is useful for storing items that
         * are referenced from both "gtk/menus-appmenu.ui" and
         * "gtk/menus-traditional.ui".
         *
         * It is also possible to provide the menus manually using
         * gtk_application_set_app_menu() and gtk_application_set_menubar().
         *
         * #GtkApplication will also automatically setup an icon search path for
         * the default icon theme by appending "icons" to the resource base
         * path.  This allows your application to easily store its icons as
         * resources.  See gtk_icon_theme_add_resource_path() for more
         * information.
         *
         * If there is a resource located at "gtk/help-overlay.ui" which
         * defines a #GtkShortcutsWindow with ID "help_overlay" then GtkApplication
         * associates an instance of this shortcuts window with each
         * #GtkApplicationWindow and sets up keyboard accelerators (Control-F1
         * and Control-?) to open it. To create a menu item that displays the
         * shortcuts window, associate the item with the action win.show-help-overlay.
         *
         * ## A simple application ## {#gtkapplication}
         *
         * [A simple example](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/blob/gtk-3-24/examples/bp/bloatpad.c)
         *
         * GtkApplication optionally registers with a session manager
         * of the users session (if you set the #GtkApplication:register-session
         * property) and offers various functionality related to the session
         * life-cycle.
         *
         * An application can block various ways to end the session with
         * the gtk_application_inhibit() function. Typical use cases for
         * this kind of inhibiting are long-running, uninterruptible operations,
         * such as burning a CD or performing a disk backup. The session
         * manager may not honor the inhibitor, but it can be expected to
         * inform the user about the negative consequences of ending the
         * session while inhibitors are present.

        /**
         * The GtkBox widget arranges child widgets into a single row or column,
         * depending upon the value of its #GtkOrientable:orientation property. Within
         * the other dimension, all children are allocated the same size. Of course,
         * the #GtkWidget:halign and #GtkWidget:valign properties can be used on
         * the children to influence their allocation.
         *
         * GtkBox uses a notion of packing. Packing refers
         * to adding widgets with reference to a particular position in a
         * #GtkContainer. For a GtkBox, there are two reference positions: the
         * start and the end of the box.
         * For a vertical #GtkBox, the start is defined as the top of the box and
         * the end is defined as the bottom. For a horizontal #GtkBox the start
         * is defined as the left side and the end is defined as the right side.
         *
         * Use repeated calls to gtk_box_pack_start() to pack widgets into a
         * GtkBox from start to end. Use gtk_box_pack_end() to add widgets from
         * end to start. You may intersperse these calls and add widgets from
         * both ends of the same GtkBox.
         *
         * Because GtkBox is a #GtkContainer, you may also use gtk_container_add()
         * to insert widgets into the box, and they will be packed with the default
         * values for expand and fill child properties. Use gtk_container_remove()
         * to remove widgets from the GtkBox.
         *
         * Use gtk_box_set_homogeneous() to specify whether or not all children
         * of the GtkBox are forced to get the same amount of space.
         *
         * Use gtk_box_set_spacing() to determine how much space will be
         * minimally placed between all children in the GtkBox. Note that
         * spacing is added between the children, while
         * padding added by gtk_box_pack_start() or gtk_box_pack_end() is added
         * on either side of the widget it belongs to.
         *
         * Use gtk_box_reorder_child() to move a GtkBox child to a different
         * place in the box.
         *
         * Use gtk_box_set_child_packing() to reset the expand,
         * fill and padding child properties.
         * Use gtk_box_query_child_packing() to query these fields.
         *
         * # CSS nodes
         *
         * GtkBox uses a single CSS node with name box.
         *
         * In horizontal orientation, the nodes of the children are always arranged
         * from left to right. So :first-child will always select the leftmost child,
         * regardless of text direction.

         * The #GtkCellRenderer is a base class of a set of objects used for
         * rendering a cell to a #cairo_t.  These objects are used primarily by
         * the #GtkTreeView widget, though they aren’t tied to them in any
         * specific way.  It is worth noting that #GtkCellRenderer is not a
         * #GtkWidget and cannot be treated as such.
         *
         * The primary use of a #GtkCellRenderer is for drawing a certain graphical
         * elements on a #cairo_t. Typically, one cell renderer is used to
         * draw many cells on the screen.  To this extent, it isn’t expected that a
         * CellRenderer keep any permanent state around.  Instead, any state is set
         * just prior to use using #GObjects property system.  Then, the
         * cell is measured using gtk_cell_renderer_get_size(). Finally, the cell
         * is rendered in the correct location using gtk_cell_renderer_render().
         *
         * There are a number of rules that must be followed when writing a new
         * #GtkCellRenderer.  First and foremost, it’s important that a certain set
         * of properties will always yield a cell renderer of the same size,
         * barring a #GtkStyle change.  The #GtkCellRenderer also has a number of
         * generic properties that are expected to be honored by all children.
         *
         * Beyond merely rendering a cell, cell renderers can optionally
         * provide active user interface elements. A cell renderer can be
         * “activatable” like #GtkCellRendererToggle,
         * which toggles when it gets activated by a mouse click, or it can be
         * “editable” like #GtkCellRendererText, which
         * allows the user to edit the text using a widget implementing the
         * #GtkCellEditable interface, e.g. #GtkEntry.
         * To make a cell renderer activatable or editable, you have to
         * implement the #GtkCellRendererClass.activate or
         * #GtkCellRendererClass.start_editing virtual functions, respectively.
         *
         * Many properties of #GtkCellRenderer and its subclasses have a
         * corresponding “set” property, e.g. “cell-background-set” corresponds
         * to “cell-background”. These “set” properties reflect whether a property
         * has been set or not. You should not set them independently.

        /**
         * The #GtkClipboard object represents a clipboard of data shared
         * between different processes or between different widgets in
         * the same process. Each clipboard is identified by a name encoded as a
         * #GdkAtom. (Conversion to and from strings can be done with
         * gdk_atom_intern() and gdk_atom_name().) The default clipboard
         * corresponds to the “CLIPBOARD” atom; another commonly used clipboard
         * is the “PRIMARY” clipboard, which, in X, traditionally contains
         * the currently selected text.
         *
         * To support having a number of different formats on the clipboard
         * at the same time, the clipboard mechanism allows providing
         * callbacks instead of the actual data.  When you set the contents
         * of the clipboard, you can either supply the data directly (via
         * functions like gtk_clipboard_set_text()), or you can supply a
         * callback to be called at a later time when the data is needed (via
         * gtk_clipboard_set_with_data() or gtk_clipboard_set_with_owner().)
         * Providing a callback also avoids having to make copies of the data
         * when it is not needed.
         *
         * gtk_clipboard_set_with_data() and gtk_clipboard_set_with_owner()
         * are quite similar; the choice between the two depends mostly on
         * which is more convenient in a particular situation.
         * The former is most useful when you want to have a blob of data
         * with callbacks to convert it into the various data types that you
         * advertise. When the @clear_func you provided is called, you
         * simply free the data blob. The latter is more useful when the
         * contents of clipboard reflect the internal state of a #GObject
         * (As an example, for the PRIMARY clipboard, when an entry widget
         * provides the clipboard’s contents the contents are simply the
         * text within the selected region.) If the contents change, the
         * entry widget can call gtk_clipboard_set_with_owner() to update
         * the timestamp for clipboard ownership, without having to worry
         * about @clear_func being called.
         *
         * Requesting the data from the clipboard is essentially
         * asynchronous. If the contents of the clipboard are provided within
         * the same process, then a direct function call will be made to
         * retrieve the data, but if they are provided by another process,
         * then the data needs to be retrieved from the other process, which
         * may take some time. To avoid blocking the user interface, the call
         * to request the selection, gtk_clipboard_request_contents() takes a
         * callback that will be called when the contents are received (or
         * when the request fails.) If you don’t want to deal with providing
         * a separate callback, you can also use gtk_clipboard_wait_for_contents().
         * What this does is run the GLib main loop recursively waiting for
         * the contents. This can simplify the code flow, but you still have
         * to be aware that other callbacks in your program can be called
         * while this recursive mainloop is running.
         *
         * Along with the functions to get the clipboard contents as an
         * arbitrary data chunk, there are also functions to retrieve
         * it as text, gtk_clipboard_request_text() and
         * gtk_clipboard_wait_for_text(). These functions take care of
         * determining which formats are advertised by the clipboard
         * provider, asking for the clipboard in the best available format
         * and converting the results into the UTF-8 encoding. (The standard
         * form for representing strings in GTK+.)

         * #GtkEntryCompletion is an auxiliary object to be used in conjunction with
         * #GtkEntry to provide the completion functionality. It implements the
         * #GtkCellLayout interface, to allow the user to add extra cells to the
         * #GtkTreeView with completion matches.
         *
         * “Completion functionality” means that when the user modifies the text
         * in the entry, #GtkEntryCompletion checks which rows in the model match
         * the current content of the entry, and displays a list of matches.
         * By default, the matching is done by comparing the entry text
         * case-insensitively against the text column of the model (see
         * gtk_entry_completion_set_text_column()), but this can be overridden
         * with a custom match function (see gtk_entry_completion_set_match_func()).
         *
         * When the user selects a completion, the content of the entry is
         * updated. By default, the content of the entry is replaced by the
         * text column of the model, but this can be overridden by connecting
         * to the #GtkEntryCompletion::match-selected signal and updating the
         * entry in the signal handler. Note that you should return %TRUE from
         * the signal handler to suppress the default behaviour.
         *
         * To add completion functionality to an entry, use gtk_entry_set_completion().
         *
         * In addition to regular completion matches, which will be inserted into the
         * entry when they are selected, #GtkEntryCompletion also allows to display
         * “actions” in the popup window. Their appearance is similar to menuitems,
         * to differentiate them clearly from completion strings. When an action is
         * selected, the #GtkEntryCompletion::action-activated signal is emitted.
         *
         * GtkEntryCompletion uses a #GtkTreeModelFilter model to represent the
         * subset of the entire model that is currently matching. While the
         * GtkEntryCompletion signals #GtkEntryCompletion::match-selected and
         * #GtkEntryCompletion::cursor-on-match take the original model and an
         * iter pointing to that model as arguments, other callbacks and signals
         * (such as #GtkCellLayoutDataFuncs or #GtkCellArea::apply-attributes)
         * will generally take the filter model as argument. As long as you are
         * only calling gtk_tree_model_get(), this will make no difference to
         * you. If for some reason, you need the original model, use
         * gtk_tree_model_filter_get_model(). Don’t forget to use
         * gtk_tree_model_filter_convert_iter_to_child_iter() to obtain a
         * matching iter.

             * mask for the descendant window (see gtk_widget_add_events()),
             * it won’t be received by the event box.
             *
             * This problem doesn’t occur for visible event boxes, because in
             * that case, the event box window is actually the ancestor of the

         * #GtkEventControllerScroll is an event controller meant to handle
         * scroll events from mice and touchpads. It is capable of handling
         * both discrete and continuous scroll events, abstracting them both
         * on the #GtkEventControllerScroll::scroll signal (deltas in the
         * discrete case are multiples of 1).
         *
         * In the case of continuous scroll events, #GtkEventControllerScroll
         * encloses all #GtkEventControllerScroll::scroll events between two
         * #GtkEventControllerScroll::scroll-begin and #GtkEventControllerScroll::scroll-end
         * signals.
         *
         * The behavior of the event controller can be modified by the
         * flags given at creation time, or modified at a later point through
         * gtk_event_controller_scroll_set_flags() (e.g. because the scrolling
         * conditions of the widget changed).
         *
         * The controller can be set up to emit motion for either/both vertical
         * and horizontal scroll events through #GTK_EVENT_CONTROLLER_SCROLL_VERTICAL,
         * #GTK_EVENT_CONTROLLER_SCROLL_HORIZONTAL and #GTK_EVENT_CONTROLLER_SCROLL_BOTH.
         * If any axis is disabled, the respective #GtkEventControllerScroll::scroll
         * delta will be 0. Vertical scroll events will be translated to horizontal
         * motion for the devices incapable of horizontal scrolling.
         *
         * The event controller can also be forced to emit discrete events on all devices
         * through #GTK_EVENT_CONTROLLER_SCROLL_DISCRETE. This can be used to implement
         * discrete actions triggered through scroll events (e.g. switching across
         * combobox options).
         *
         * The #GTK_EVENT_CONTROLLER_SCROLL_KINETIC flag toggles the emission of the
         * #GtkEventControllerScroll::decelerate signal, emitted at the end of scrolling
         * with two X/Y velocity arguments that are consistent with the motion that
         * was received.

         * ## Setting up a file chooser dialog ## {#gtkfilechooserdialog-setting-up}
         *
         * There are various cases in which you may need to use a #GtkFileChooserDialog:
         *
         * - To select a file for opening. Use #GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN.
         *
         * - To save a file for the first time. Use #GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE,
         *   and suggest a name such as “Untitled” with gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name().
         *
         * - To save a file under a different name. Use #GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE,
         *   and set the existing filename with gtk_file_chooser_set_filename().
         *
         * - To choose a folder instead of a file. Use #GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SELECT_FOLDER.
         *
         * Note that old versions of the file chooser’s documentation suggested
         * using gtk_file_chooser_set_current_folder() in various
         * situations, with the intention of letting the application
         * suggest a reasonable default folder.  This is no longer
         * considered to be a good policy, as now the file chooser is
         * able to make good suggestions on its own.  In general, you
         * should only cause the file chooser to show a specific folder
         * when it is appropriate to use gtk_file_chooser_set_filename(),
         * i.e. when you are doing a Save As command and you already
         * have a file saved somewhere.
         *
         * ## Response Codes ## {#gtkfilechooserdialog-responses}
         *
         * #GtkFileChooserDialog inherits from #GtkDialog, so buttons that
         * go in its action area have response codes such as
         * #GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT and #GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL.  For example, you
         * could call gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new() as follows:
         *
         * |[
         * GtkWidget *dialog;
         * GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN;
         *
         * dialog = gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new ("Open File",
         *                                       parent_window,
         *                                       action,
         *                                       _("_Cancel"),
         *                                       GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL,
         *                                       _("_Open"),
         *                                       GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
         *                                       NULL);
         * ]|
         *
         * This will create buttons for “Cancel” and “Open” that use stock
         * response identifiers from #GtkResponseType.  For most dialog
         * boxes you can use your own custom response codes rather than the
         * ones in #GtkResponseType, but #GtkFileChooserDialog assumes that
         * its “accept”-type action, e.g. an “Open” or “Save” button,
         * will have one of the following response codes:
         *
         * - #GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT
         * - #GTK_RESPONSE_OK
         * - #GTK_RESPONSE_YES
         * - #GTK_RESPONSE_APPLY
         *
         * This is because #GtkFileChooserDialog must intercept responses
         * and switch to folders if appropriate, rather than letting the
         * dialog terminate — the implementation uses these known
         * response codes to know which responses can be blocked if
         * appropriate.
         *
         * To summarize, make sure you use a
         * [stock response code][gtkfilechooserdialog-responses]
         * when you use #GtkFileChooserDialog to ensure proper operation.

         * ## Response Codes ## {#gtkfilechooserdialognative-responses}
         *
         * #GtkFileChooserNative inherits from #GtkNativeDialog, which means it
         * will return #GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT if the user accepted, and
         * #GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL if he pressed cancel. It can also return
         * #GTK_RESPONSE_DELETE_EVENT if the window was unexpectedly closed.
         *
         * ## Differences from #GtkFileChooserDialog ##  {#gtkfilechooserdialognative-differences}
         *
         * There are a few things in the GtkFileChooser API that are not
         * possible to use with #GtkFileChooserNative, as such use would
         * prohibit the use of a native dialog.
         *
         * There is no support for the signals that are emitted when the user
         * navigates in the dialog, including:
         * * #GtkFileChooser::current-folder-changed
         * * #GtkFileChooser::selection-changed
         * * #GtkFileChooser::file-activated
         * * #GtkFileChooser::confirm-overwrite
         *
         * You can also not use the methods that directly control user navigation:
         * * gtk_file_chooser_unselect_filename()
         * * gtk_file_chooser_select_all()
         * * gtk_file_chooser_unselect_all()
         *
         * If you need any of the above you will have to use #GtkFileChooserDialog directly.
         *
         * No operations that change the the dialog work while the dialog is
         * visible. Set all the properties that are required before showing the dialog.
         *
         * ## Win32 details ## {#gtkfilechooserdialognative-win32}
         *
         * On windows the IFileDialog implementation (added in Windows Vista) is
         * used. It supports many of the features that #GtkFileChooserDialog
         * does, but there are some things it does not handle:
         *
         * * Extra widgets added with gtk_file_chooser_set_extra_widget().
         *
         * * Use of custom previews by connecting to #GtkFileChooser::update-preview.
         *
         * * Any #GtkFileFilter added using a mimetype or custom filter.
         *
         * If any of these features are used the regular #GtkFileChooserDialog
         * will be used in place of the native one.
         *
         * ## Portal details ## {#gtkfilechooserdialognative-portal}
         *
         * When the org.freedesktop.portal.FileChooser portal is available on the
         * session bus, it is used to bring up an out-of-process file chooser. Depending
         * on the kind of session the application is running in, this may or may not
         * be a GTK+ file chooser. In this situation, the following things are not
         * supported and will be silently ignored:
         *
         * * Extra widgets added with gtk_file_chooser_set_extra_widget().
         *
         * * Use of custom previews by connecting to #GtkFileChooser::update-preview.
         *
         * * Any #GtkFileFilter added with a custom filter.
         *
         * ## macOS details ## {#gtkfilechooserdialognative-macos}
         *
         * On macOS the NSSavePanel and NSOpenPanel classes are used to provide native
         * file chooser dialogs. Some features provided by #GtkFileChooserDialog are
         * not supported:
         *
         * * Extra widgets added with gtk_file_chooser_set_extra_widget(), unless the
         *   widget is an instance of GtkLabel, in which case the label text will be used
         *   to set the NSSavePanel message instance property.
         *
         * * Use of custom previews by connecting to #GtkFileChooser::update-preview.
         *
         * * Any #GtkFileFilter added with a custom filter.
         *
         * * Shortcut folders.

         * The #GtkFixed widget is a container which can place child widgets
         * at fixed positions and with fixed sizes, given in pixels. #GtkFixed
         * performs no automatic layout management.
         *
         * For most applications, you should not use this container! It keeps
         * you from having to learn about the other GTK+ containers, but it
         * results in broken applications.  With #GtkFixed, the following
         * things will result in truncated text, overlapping widgets, and
         * other display bugs:
         *
         * - Themes, which may change widget sizes.
         *
         * - Fonts other than the one you used to write the app will of course
         *   change the size of widgets containing text; keep in mind that
         *   users may use a larger font because of difficulty reading the
         *   default, or they may be using a different OS that provides different fonts.
         *
         * - Translation of text into other languages changes its size. Also,
         *   display of non-English text will use a different font in many
         *   cases.
         *
         * In addition, #GtkFixed does not pay attention to text direction and thus may
         * produce unwanted results if your app is run under right-to-left languages
         * such as Hebrew or Arabic. That is: normally GTK+ will order containers
         * appropriately for the text direction, e.g. to put labels to the right of the
         * thing they label when using an RTL language, but it can’t do that with
         * #GtkFixed. So if you need to reorder widgets depending on the text direction,
         * you would need to manually detect it and adjust child positions accordingly.
         *
         * Finally, fixed positioning makes it kind of annoying to add/remove
         * GUI elements, since you have to reposition all the other
         * elements. This is a long-term maintenance problem for your
         * application.
         *
         * If you know none of these things are an issue for your application,
         * and prefer the simplicity of #GtkFixed, by all means use the
         * widget. But you should be aware of the tradeoffs.
         *
         * See also #GtkLayout, which shares the ability to perform fixed positioning
         * of child widgets and additionally adds custom drawing and scrollability.

         * #GtkGesture is the base object for gesture recognition, although this
         * object is quite generalized to serve as a base for multi-touch gestures,
         * it is suitable to implement single-touch and pointer-based gestures (using
         * the special %NULL #GdkEventSequence value for these).
         *
         * The number of touches that a #GtkGesture need to be recognized is controlled
         * by the #GtkGesture:n-points property, if a gesture is keeping track of less
         * or more than that number of sequences, it won't check wether the gesture
         * is recognized.
         *
         * As soon as the gesture has the expected number of touches, the gesture will
         * run the #GtkGesture::check signal regularly on input events until the gesture
         * is recognized, the criteria to consider a gesture as "recognized" is left to
         * #GtkGesture subclasses.
         *
         * A recognized gesture will then emit the following signals:
         * - #GtkGesture::begin when the gesture is recognized.
         * - A number of #GtkGesture::update, whenever an input event is processed.
         * - #GtkGesture::end when the gesture is no longer recognized.
         *
         * ## Event propagation
         *
         * In order to receive events, a gesture needs to either set a propagation phase
         * through gtk_event_controller_set_propagation_phase(), or feed those manually
         * through gtk_event_controller_handle_event().
         *
         * In the capture phase, events are propagated from the toplevel down to the
         * target widget, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget
         * get a chance to interact with the event before it reaches the target.
         *
         * After the capture phase, GTK+ emits the traditional #GtkWidget::button-press-event,
         * #GtkWidget::button-release-event, #GtkWidget::touch-event, etc signals. Gestures
         * with the %GTK_PHASE_TARGET phase are fed events from the default #GtkWidget::event
         * handlers.
         *
         * In the bubble phase, events are propagated up from the target widget to the
         * toplevel, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget get
         * a chance to interact with events that have not been handled yet.
         *
         * ## States of a sequence # {#touch-sequence-states}
         *
         * Whenever input interaction happens, a single event may trigger a cascade of
         * #GtkGestures, both across the parents of the widget receiving the event and
         * in parallel within an individual widget. It is a responsibility of the
         * widgets using those gestures to set the state of touch sequences accordingly
         * in order to enable cooperation of gestures around the #GdkEventSequences
         * triggering those.
         *
         * Within a widget, gestures can be grouped through gtk_gesture_group(),
         * grouped gestures synchronize the state of sequences, so calling
         * gtk_gesture_set_sequence_state() on one will effectively propagate
         * the state throughout the group.
         *
         * By default, all sequences start out in the #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_NONE state,
         * sequences in this state trigger the gesture event handler, but event
         * propagation will continue unstopped by gestures.
         *
         * If a sequence enters into the #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED state, the gesture
         * group will effectively ignore the sequence, letting events go unstopped
         * through the gesture, but the "slot" will still remain occupied while
         * the touch is active.
         *
         * If a sequence enters in the #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED state, the gesture
         * group will grab all interaction on the sequence, by:
         * - Setting the same sequence to #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED on every other gesture
         *   group within the widget, and every gesture on parent widgets in the propagation
         *   chain.
         * - calling #GtkGesture::cancel on every gesture in widgets underneath in the
         *   propagation chain.
         * - Stopping event propagation after the gesture group handles the event.
         *
         * Note: if a sequence is set early to #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED on
         * #GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN/#GDK_BUTTON_PRESS (so those events are captured before
         * reaching the event widget, this implies #GTK_PHASE_CAPTURE), one similar
         * event will emulated if the sequence changes to #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED.
         * This way event coherence is preserved before event propagation is unstopped
         * again.
         *
         * Sequence states can't be changed freely, see gtk_gesture_set_sequence_state()
         * to know about the possible lifetimes of a #GdkEventSequence.
         *
         * ## Touchpad gestures
         *
         * On the platforms that support it, #GtkGesture will handle transparently
         * touchpad gesture events. The only precautions users of #GtkGesture should do
         * to enable this support are:
         * - Enabling %GDK_TOUCHPAD_GESTURE_MASK on their #GdkWindows
         * - If the gesture has %GTK_PHASE_NONE, ensuring events of type
         *   %GDK_TOUCHPAD_SWIPE and %GDK_TOUCHPAD_PINCH are handled by the #GtkGesture

         * The #GtkMenuButton widget is used to display a popup when clicked on.
         * This popup can be provided either as a #GtkMenu, a #GtkPopover or an
         * abstract #GMenuModel.
         *
         * The #GtkMenuButton widget can hold any valid child widget. That is, it
         * can hold almost any other standard #GtkWidget. The most commonly used
         * child is #GtkImage. If no widget is explicitely added to the #GtkMenuButton,
         * a #GtkImage is automatically created, using an arrow image oriented
         * according to #GtkMenuButton:direction or the generic “open-menu-symbolic”
         * icon if the direction is not set.
         *
         * The positioning of the popup is determined by the #GtkMenuButton:direction
         * property of the menu button.
         *
         * For menus, the #GtkWidget:halign and #GtkWidget:valign properties of the
         * menu are also taken into account. For example, when the direction is
         * %GTK_ARROW_DOWN and the horizontal alignment is %GTK_ALIGN_START, the
         * menu will be positioned below the button, with the starting edge
         * (depending on the text direction) of the menu aligned with the starting
         * edge of the button. If there is not enough space below the button, the
         * menu is popped up above the button instead. If the alignment would move
         * part of the menu offscreen, it is “pushed in”.

             * menus but doesn’t make sense for menubars.
             *
             * If @action_namespace is non-%NULL then the effect is as if all
             * actions mentioned in the @model have their names prefixed with the
             * namespace, plus a dot.  For example, if the action “quit” is
             * mentioned and @action_namespace is “app” then the effective action
             * name is “app.quit”.
             *
             * This function uses #GtkActionable to define the action name and
             * target values on the created menu items.  If you want to use an
             * action group other than “app” and “win”, or if you want to use a
             * #GtkMenuShell outside of a #GtkApplicationWindow, then you will need
             * to attach your own action group to the widget hierarchy using
             * gtk_widget_insert_action_group().  As an example, if you created a
             * group with a “quit” action and inserted it with the name “mygroup”
             * then you would use the action name “mygroup.quit” in your
             * #GMenuModel.
             *
             * For most cases you are probably better off using
             * gtk_menu_new_from_model() or gtk_menu_bar_new_from_model() or just
             * directly passing the #GMenuModel to gtk_application_set_app_menu() or

         * allows individual applications to provide extra shortcut folders that are unique
         * to each application.  For example, a Paint program may want to add a shortcut
         * for a Clipart folder.  You can do this with gtk_places_sidebar_add_shortcut().
         *
         * To make use of the places sidebar, an application at least needs to connect
         * to the #GtkPlacesSidebar::open-location signal.  This is emitted when the
         * user selects in the sidebar a location to open.  The application should also
         * call gtk_places_sidebar_set_location() when it changes the currently-viewed
         * location.
         *
         * # CSS nodes
         *
         * GtkPlacesSidebar uses a single CSS node with name placessidebar and style
         * class .sidebar.
         *
         * Among the children of the places sidebar, the following style classes can
         * be used:
         * - .sidebar-new-bookmark-row for the 'Add new bookmark' row
         * - .sidebar-placeholder-row for a row that is a placeholder
         * - .has-open-popup when a popup is open for a row

         * ]|
         *
         * Unless #GtkScrolledWindow:policy is GTK_POLICY_NEVER or GTK_POLICY_EXTERNAL,
         * GtkScrolledWindow adds internal #GtkScrollbar widgets around its child. The
         * scroll position of the child, and if applicable the scrollbars, is controlled
         * by the #GtkScrolledWindow:hadjustment and #GtkScrolledWindow:vadjustment
         * that are associated with the GtkScrolledWindow. See the docs on #GtkScrollbar
         * for the details, but note that the “step_increment” and “page_increment”
         * fields are only effective if the policy causes scrollbars to be present.
         *
         * If a GtkScrolledWindow doesn’t behave quite as you would like, or
         * doesn’t have exactly the right layout, it’s very possible to set up
         * your own scrolling with #GtkScrollbar and for example a #GtkGrid.
         *
         * # Touch support
         *
         * GtkScrolledWindow has built-in support for touch devices. When a
         * touchscreen is used, swiping will move the scrolled window, and will
         * expose 'kinetic' behavior. This can be turned off with the
         * #GtkScrolledWindow:kinetic-scrolling property if it is undesired.
         *
         * GtkScrolledWindow also displays visual 'overshoot' indication when
         * the content is pulled beyond the end, and this situation can be
         * captured with the #GtkScrolledWindow::edge-overshot signal.
         *
         * If no mouse device is present, the scrollbars will overlayed as
         * narrow, auto-hiding indicators over the content. If traditional
         * scrollbars are desired although no mouse is present, this behaviour
         * can be turned off with the #GtkScrolledWindow:overlay-scrolling
         * property.
         *
         * # CSS nodes
         *
         * GtkScrolledWindow has a main CSS node with name scrolledwindow.
         *
         * It uses subnodes with names overshoot and undershoot to
         * draw the overflow and underflow indications. These nodes get
         * the .left, .right, .top or .bottom style class added depending
         * on where the indication is drawn.
         *
         * GtkScrolledWindow also sets the positional style classes (.left,
         * .right, .top, .bottom) and style classes related to overlay
         * scrolling (.overlay-indicator, .dragging, .hovering) on its scrollbars.
         *
         * If both scrollbars are visible, the area where they meet is drawn
         * with a subnode named junction.

         * icons as the only way to convey critical information regarding your application,
         * as the notification area may not exist on the user's environment, or may have
         * been removed. You should always check that a status icon has been embedded into
         * a notification area by using gtk_status_icon_is_embedded(), and gracefully
         * recover if the function returns %FALSE.
         *
         * On X11, the implementation follows the
         * [FreeDesktop System Tray Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/systemtray-spec).
         * Implementations of the “tray” side of this specification can
         * be found e.g. in the GNOME 2 and KDE panel applications.
         *
         * Note that a GtkStatusIcon is not a widget, but just a #GObject. Making it a
         * widget would be impractical, since the system tray on Windows doesn’t allow
         * to embed arbitrary widgets.
         *
         * GtkStatusIcon has been deprecated in 3.14. You should consider using
         * notifications or more modern platform-specific APIs instead. GLib provides
         * the #GNotification API which works well with #GtkApplication on multiple
         * platforms and environments, and should be the preferred mechanism to notify
         * the users of transient status updates. See this [HowDoI](https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/GNotification)
         * for code examples.

         * A #GtkTextMark is like a bookmark in a text buffer; it preserves a position in
         * the text. You can convert the mark to an iterator using
         * gtk_text_buffer_get_iter_at_mark(). Unlike iterators, marks remain valid across
         * buffer mutations, because their behavior is defined when text is inserted or
         * deleted. When text containing a mark is deleted, the mark remains in the
         * position originally occupied by the deleted text. When text is inserted at a
         * mark, a mark with “left gravity” will be moved to the
         * beginning of the newly-inserted text, and a mark with “right
         * gravity” will be moved to the end.
         *
         * Note that “left” and “right” here refer to logical direction (left
         * is the toward the start of the buffer); in some languages such as
         * Hebrew the logically-leftmost text is not actually on the left when
         * displayed.
         *
         * Marks are reference counted, but the reference count only controls the validity
         * of the memory; marks can be deleted from the buffer at any time with
         * gtk_text_buffer_delete_mark(). Once deleted from the buffer, a mark is
         * essentially useless.
         *
         * Marks optionally have names; these can be convenient to avoid passing the
         * #GtkTextMark object around.
         *
         * Marks are typically created using the gtk_text_buffer_create_mark() function.

         * - Connect to the #GtkWidget::query-tooltip signal.  This signal will be
         *   emitted when a tooltip is supposed to be shown. One of the arguments passed
         *   to the signal handler is a GtkTooltip object. This is the object that we
         *   are about to display as a tooltip, and can be manipulated in your callback
         *   using functions like gtk_tooltip_set_icon(). There are functions for setting
         *   the tooltip’s markup, setting an image from a named icon, or even putting in
         *   a custom widget.
         *
         *   Return %TRUE from your query-tooltip handler. This causes the tooltip to be
         *   show. If you return %FALSE, it will not be shown.
         *
         * In the probably rare case where you want to have even more control over the
         * tooltip that is about to be shown, you can set your own #GtkWindow which
         * will be used as tooltip window.  This works as follows:
         *
         * - Set #GtkWidget:has-tooltip and connect to #GtkWidget::query-tooltip as before.
         *   Use gtk_widget_set_tooltip_window() to set a #GtkWindow created by you as
         *   tooltip window.
         *
         * - In the #GtkWidget::query-tooltip callback you can access your window using
         *   gtk_widget_get_tooltip_window() and manipulate as you wish. The semantics of
         *   the return value are exactly as before, return %TRUE to show the window,

         * A #GtkTreeModelFilter is a tree model which wraps another tree model,
         * and can do the following things:
         *
         * - Filter specific rows, based on data from a “visible column”, a column
         *   storing booleans indicating whether the row should be filtered or not,
         *   or based on the return value of a “visible function”, which gets a
         *   model, iter and user_data and returns a boolean indicating whether the
         *   row should be filtered or not.
         *
         * - Modify the “appearance” of the model, using a modify function.
         *   This is extremely powerful and allows for just changing some
         *   values and also for creating a completely different model based
         *   on the given child model.
         *
         * - Set a different root node, also known as a “virtual root”. You can pass
         *   in a #GtkTreePath indicating the root node for the filter at construction
         *   time.
         *
         * The basic API is similar to #GtkTreeModelSort. For an example on its usage,
         * see the section on #GtkTreeModelSort.
         *
         * When using #GtkTreeModelFilter, it is important to realize that
         * #GtkTreeModelFilter maintains an internal cache of all nodes which are
         * visible in its clients. The cache is likely to be a subtree of the tree
         * exposed by the child model. #GtkTreeModelFilter will not cache the entire
         * child model when unnecessary to not compromise the caching mechanism
         * that is exposed by the reference counting scheme. If the child model
         * implements reference counting, unnecessary signals may not be emitted
         * because of reference counting rule 3, see the #GtkTreeModel
         * documentation. (Note that e.g. #GtkTreeStore does not implement
         * reference counting and will always emit all signals, even when
         * the receiving node is not visible).
         *
         * Because of this, limitations for possible visible functions do apply.
         * In general, visible functions should only use data or properties from
         * the node for which the visibility state must be determined, its siblings
         * or its parents. Usually, having a dependency on the state of any child
         * node is not possible, unless references are taken on these explicitly.
         * When no such reference exists, no signals may be received for these child
         * nodes (see reference couting rule number 3 in the #GtkTreeModel section).
         *
         * Determining the visibility state of a given node based on the state
         * of its child nodes is a frequently occurring use case. Therefore,
         * #GtkTreeModelFilter explicitly supports this. For example, when a node
         * does not have any children, you might not want the node to be visible.
         * As soon as the first row is added to the node’s child level (or the
         * last row removed), the node’s visibility should be updated.
         *
         * This introduces a dependency from the node on its child nodes. In order
         * to accommodate this, #GtkTreeModelFilter must make sure the necessary
         * signals are received from the child model. This is achieved by building,
         * for all nodes which are exposed as visible nodes to #GtkTreeModelFilter's
         * clients, the child level (if any) and take a reference on the first node
         * in this level. Furthermore, for every row-inserted, row-changed or
         * row-deleted signal (also these which were not handled because the node
         * was not cached), #GtkTreeModelFilter will check if the visibility state

             * support a global coordinate system, and thus the position of the

             * way to obtain the geometry of the decorations of a window if they are
             * provided by the window manager. Additionally, on X11, window manager

             * moving even if you use the coordinates of the current position as
             * returned by this function.

             * If you haven’t changed the window gravity, its gravity will be

             * gets the position of the top-left corner of the window manager
             * frame for the window. gtk_window_move() sets the position of this
             * same top-left corner.
             *
             * If a window has gravity #GDK_GRAVITY_STATIC the window manager
             * frame is not relevant, and thus gtk_window_get_position() will
             * always produce accurate results. However you can’t use static
             * gravity to do things like place a window in a corner of the screen,

         *
         * While you should not call this function directly, you might want to
         * know how exactly events are handled. So here is what this function
         * does with the event:
         *
         * 1. Compress enter/leave notify events. If the event passed build an
         *    enter/leave pair together with the next event (peeked from GDK), both
         *    events are thrown away. This is to avoid a backlog of (de-)highlighting
         *    widgets crossed by the pointer.
         *
         * 2. Find the widget which got the event. If the widget can’t be determined
         *    the event is thrown away unless it belongs to a INCR transaction.
         *
         * 3. Then the event is pushed onto a stack so you can query the currently
         *    handled event with gtk_get_current_event().
         *
         * 4. The event is sent to a widget. If a grab is active all events for widgets
         *    that are not in the contained in the grab widget are sent to the latter
         *    with a few exceptions:
         *    - Deletion and destruction events are still sent to the event widget for
         *      obvious reasons.
         *    - Events which directly relate to the visual representation of the event
         *      widget.
         *    - Leave events are delivered to the event widget if there was an enter
         *      event delivered to it before without the paired leave event.
         *    - Drag events are not redirected because it is unclear what the semantics
         *      of that would be.
         *    Another point of interest might be that all key events are first passed
         *    through the key snooper functions if there are any. Read the description
         *    of gtk_key_snooper_install() if you need this feature.
         *
