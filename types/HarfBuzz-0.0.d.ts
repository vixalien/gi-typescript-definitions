             * 				   if it is, just splice it into place and the line
             * 				   is shaped; If not, move on to a position further
             * 				   back that is clear of unsafe-to-concat and retry
             * 				   from there, and repeat.
             * 				   At the start of next line a similar algorithm can
             * 				   be implemented. That is: 1. Iterate forward from
             * 				   the line-break position until the first cluster
             * 				   start position that is NOT unsafe-to-concat, 2.
             * 				   shape the segment from beginning of the line to

             * 				   glyph-run also is clear of the unsafe-to-concat
             * 				   at its end-of-text position; if it is, just splice
             * 				   it into place and the beginning is shaped; If not,
             * 				   move on to a position further forward that is clear
             * 				   of unsafe-to-concat and retry up to there, and repeat.
             * 				   A slight complication will arise in the
             * 				   implementation of the algorithm above,
             * 				   because while our buffer API has a way to
             * 				   return flags for position corresponding to
             * 				   start-of-text, there is currently no position
